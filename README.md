# Hi!

This is a pretty basic clone of the popular reddit experiment, r/place, that lets users place 1 pixel on a 1000x1000 grid every 5 minutes. Mine lets you place 1 pixel every half second, and is overall a lot more basic. It was still a really fun project, my biggest to date and I learned a lot.

Have fun! (and please don't break it...)
